    <p>This is a sample PHP application deployed to Heroku. It's a reasonably simple app - but a good foundation for understanding how to get the most out of the Heroku platform.</p>

      <h3>Transcribe 2 Braille App Project</h3>
      <p>YouTube is one of the largest web platforms in the world, providing access to billions of videos for education, entertainment, and information-sharing. Benefitting from YouTube can be challenging for DeafBlind users like myself, and I wanted to figure out a way we could partake in "watching" YouTube videos.</p>
      <p>I decided to leverage Python in conjunction with Pytube and the youtube-traarscript-api to build the Transcribe 2 Braille application. This Transcribe 2 Braille app works by allowing users to input a specific YouTube video URL, hit submit, and then the app will generate a transcript which can be downloaded and enlarged for better viewing, or used through screen readers.
The Transcribe 2 Braille app benefits more than just DeafBlind and Blind users -- this app also benefits abled users who wish to utilize the non-linear format, read at their own pace, and track down specific words in the transcript.</p>
<p>While this app works with YouTube videos using automatic captions, it is best to ensure the video you are trying to transcribe already has English captions for best accuracy and reliability.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy using the Transcribe 2 Braille app, and please feel free to fork my project or leave some comments!</p>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are following the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php">Getting Started</a> guide, then please head back to the tutorial and follow the next steps!</li>
        <li>If you deployed this app by deploying the Heroku Button, then in a command line shell, run:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>git clone https://github.com/heroku/php-getting-started.git</code> - this will create a local copy of the source code for the app</li>
          <li><code>cd php-getting-started</code> - change directory into the local source code repository</li>
          <li><code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;your-app-name></code> - associate the Heroku app with the repository</li>
          <li>You'll now be set up to run the app locally, or <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#push-local-changes">deploy changes</a> to Heroku</li>
        </ul>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
